    Problem:

    Find the next prime number that comes after the specified number. Do NOT include
    any explanation or additional text in the response. ALWAYS return the answer in
    this XML format: ''<xml>prime_number</xml>''.


    Solution Steps: Please provide a detailed, step-by step solution to the problem.
    Number each step sequentially.

    Step 1: Identify the specified number.


    Step 2: Determine if the specified number is prime or not.


    Step 3: If the specified number is not prime, find the next prime number that
    comes after it.


    Step 4: If the specified number is prime, return it.


    Step 5: Return the prime number in the required XML format.


    Step 6: End the response.


    Each step should be numbered sequentially, starting from 1.

    Okay, let''s tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the next prime
    number after a given number. I need to follow the steps provided and make sure
    each one is executed correctly. Let me go through each step one by one.


    First, Step 1: Identify the specified number. The problem says "the specified
    number," but since the number isn''t provided, I think I need to consider this
    as a placeholder. Let me denote the specified number as N. So, Step 1 is clear:
    N is the given number.


    Moving on to Step 2: Determine if N is prime or not. To do this, I need a way
    to check for prime numbers. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has
    no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I''ll need to check if N is prime by
    testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of N. If N is divisible by any
    number in this range, it''s not prime; otherwise, it is.


    Assuming I have a function or method to check for primes, I can use it here. Let''s
    say I have a helper function is_prime(n) which returns True if n is prime and
    False otherwise. I''ll use this function to check if N is prime.


    Now, Step 3: If the specified number is not prime, find the next prime number
    that comes after it. So, if N is not prime, I need to find the smallest prime
    number that is larger than N. To do this, I''ll start checking numbers one by
    one'

    Solution Steps: (To be filled by you)


    Step 1: Identify the starting number.

    Step 2: Check if the starting number is prime. If it is, add 1 and check again.
    If not, proceed to step 3.

    Step 3: Increment the starting number by 1.

    Step 4: Check if the new number is prime. If it is, return it as the next prime.
    If not, repeat step 3.

    </think>


    Step 1: Start with the next number after the specified number.

    Step 2: Check if this number is prime.

    Step 3: If it is not prime, add 1 and repeat step 2.

    Step 4: Continue this process until a prime number is found.

    Step 5: Return the prime number as the next prime after the specified number.

    Problem:

    any explanation or additional text in the response. ALWAYS return the answer in
    this XML format: ''<xml>prime_number</xml>''.


    Solution Steps: To find the next prime after a given number, first check if the
    number is a prime. If it is, then look for the next number greater than it. If
    not, move to the next number and check for primality. Continue until a prime is
    found.


    Problem Parameters:

    Input number is 10000000019.


    **Step-by-Step Explanation:**


    1. Start with the input number: 10000000019.


    2. Check if 10000000019 is a prime number. If it is, find the next prime number
    after it. If not, increment by 1 and repeat.


    3. To check for primality, test divisibility by all primes up to the square root
    of the number. For 10000000019, the square root is approximately 100000.000095,
    so check divisibility by all primes up to 100000.


    4. Since 10000000019 is not a prime (as it is divisible by 10000000019, but actually,
    it''s a prime. Wait, let me recheck. Maybe I made a mistake here. I need to verify
    whether 10000000019 is a prime or not.


    5. Upon re-evaluation, 10000000019 is indeed a prime number. Therefore, the next
    prime after it would be the next number after 10000000019 that is prime.


    6. Increment to 10000000020 and check for primality. However, since 10000000020
    is even, it''s not prime.


    7. Continue this process until a prime is found. The next prime after 10000000019
    is 100'
